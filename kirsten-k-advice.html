            <h1>Hello Crushers!<br> My name is Kirsten, and I have some advice for You!</h1>
        </header>

            <div class="advice">
                <h4>Confusion is DEFINITELY your friend! <br>Embrace confusion- it's always lurking.</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity,<br> and in the case of software development, something
                    so specific that it's probably never been done before. Kirsten agrees with all of this!</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                    have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math<br> and technology and that it's time for you
                    to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits. Kirsten cannot WAIT for clarity!</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.<br>
                     BELIEVE IN THE SUSPENSION. JUST HANG WITH IT.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through<br> this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p>

                <p>NEVER STOP!</p>

                <p>PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE! And then reward yourself for your dedication!</p>
